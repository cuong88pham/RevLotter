          CSC (Crypto Sharing Community) was founded with the belief that
          everyone should own some Bitcoin and benefit from the emerging
          Blockchain Industry. To do this we have launched a Blockchain based
          Lotto Game with a growing Jackpot paid in Bitcoin. You can share the
          game with your friends to increase your chances of winning. The more
          people that play, the bigger the Jackpot becomes!
        </p>
        <p className="ml-0 mr-0 w-100 mw-100 text-dark">
          In the near future we will launch new types of games, and expand our
          portfolio with new products and services that will bring excitement
          and enrich your life!
        </p>
        <p className="ml-0 mr-0 w-100 mw-100 text-dark">
          The best part is that entrepreneurial players can earn additional
          commissions and bonuses as CSC Ambassadors. How would you like earning
          Bitcoin every time your referrals play, or win? Wouldn’t that be
          awesome!?
